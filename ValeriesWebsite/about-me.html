                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>I was born in the summer of 1999 in Harlingen, Texas which is located in the southern tip of Texas. I am the oldest of four siblings. Since I was a little one I loved performing, dancing and singing while I watched <i>Hannah Montana</i> and <i>High School Musical</i>. It was those early years in life that would set a foundation for the career path that I would choose as I got older. Through out elementary and junior high, I was in choir which I always enjoyed. In high school I participated in theatre and was part of the traveling team for speech, drama and debate. I decided to leave my small town and move to the big city to attend college at
                American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles,
                California to get a Bachelorâ€™s of Fine Arts in Musical Theater.</p>
