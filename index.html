					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I'm a mother, a student and an entrepeneur who began a college career as a computer programmer but later ventured into the business world. After I completed a bachelors degree in business
						management and educational technology, I decided to go back to school to polish my skills as a web designer and developer. I've always had a passion for technology and I am glad I am able
						to dive into my passion and make it a career. One of the most beautiful things about technology and the world wide web is that I can be productive, efficient and resourceful from the
						comfort of my own home.
					</p>
					<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
					<p>I have many years of experiece working in sales, marketing and customer service which have equipped me with the skills to collobarate with a team and communicate with my peers and 
						clients. My experience managing a business or department has also been beneficial as it has given me the inside scoop on how to efficiently run an operation with the use of various office
						technologies by improving the workplace. Professionally I have also helped manage e-commerce websites by managing content, running e-mail campaigns, updating inventory levels and assisting the online 
						customer.
					</p>
					<h2>Whats Next</h2>
					<p>My ultimate goal is to enrich businesses and organizations by producing quality work all while I do what I am most passionate about: web design and development. </p>
