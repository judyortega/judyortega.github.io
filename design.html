					<h2>Discovery</h2>
					<p>Before I can design and develop your website, there is the discovery phase. The discovery phase consists of assessing the needs of the client during the initital interview, researching the clients market
						and its competitors, reviewing organizational goals and current branding and style guides. A design brief is created before the project is started to ensure all collaborators are on the same page and have a true grasp of the project. I
						included a design brief sample below from a recent project.
					</p>
					<h3>Design Brief Sample</h3>
					<h4>Project Goals Summary</h4>
					<p>The main purpose of the new website for The Pet Place is to create a website they can manage and update independently. Currently their website cannot be accessed by The Pet Place and it is crucial to their organization that they update pet availability frequently. The secondary goal is to attract more adopters to their organization so that more pets will be saved and given a home and this will be achieved by a more engaging home page and adoption page. Another important goal is being able to provide the audience with resources to care for their pet. Although not guaranteed, another primary goal is to give donors the ability to donate on the website. A new domain name and hosting provider will be needed. The color scheme will compliment their logo colors. The deadline for this website is 12/01/2021.
					</p>
					<h4>Target Audience Profile</h4>
					<p>The typical user demographic varies but those who wish to visit the site are those who love animals and are looking to rescue an animal from The Humane Society of Harrison County. Other users are also those who support the cause by volunteering their time and/or donating to the organization so that they can continue to help animals find a home. The typical user would most likely want to see which animals are available before visiting the facility. 
					</p>
					<h4>Perception/Tone/Guidelines</h4>
					<p>The website should be animal-friendly, warm and inviting since the typical user is one who cares about animals. Since the demographic varies, the website should be created so that anyone can find it user-friendly, both young and elderly. 
					</p>
					<h4>Communication Strategy</h4>
					<p>A user who lands on the website should not have a difficult time finding the information they need. The layout should be well-organized and easy to navigate. Most users visiting the website are either interested in adopting, spay and neutering services, volunteering and/or donating so all resources such as sign-up forms and informational notices should be available to them. 	
					</p>
					<h3>Competitive Positioning</h3>
					<p>Since people looking to adopt an animal may be looking for a specific type of animal and because it is a big commitment, they usually do research before they make a decision. Giving the user the information they need to make a decision will give The Pet Place a competitive advantage since many websites, such as those for pet stores or local ads, may lack the data they need. 
					</p>
					<h3>Targeted Message</h3>
					<p>The redesign of your website will not only give visitors an ability to browse through available pets but can also serve as a resource if they need more information about caring for their pets. It will also spread awareness of the cause and promote donations to the cause. </p>
					<h2>Wireframes</h2>
					<p>Before the designing of the website and only after the project goals have been established, a wireframe is created. A wireframe is a blueprint or a visual guide that resembles
						the framework of the website. I have included a wireframe sample below. This wireframe is also a prototype and is interactive which gives you an idea of how the website should flow.
					</p>

					<h2>Mockups</h2>
					<p>A mockup of a website comes after the design brief and the wireframe and includes the final features of the final website but lacks functionality. The structure of the website for all devices (desktop, tablet and mobile), color scheme, typography and images are all final features of the website and included in the mockup. Below is a
						sample of a mockup I created for a recent project.</p>

					<h2>Self Marketing Plan</h2>
					<p>Thanks to the world wide web we are able to market ourselves by different means. Offline marketing is still a great way of marketing yourself as well. Below is a list of ways one can market themselves and their business.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Offline Marketing</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Community events</li>
								<li>Networking events</li>
								<li>Business card trading</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Online Marketing</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Social Media posts</li>
								<li>YouTube channels</li>
								<li>Email newsletter campaigns</li>
								<li>Google ads</li>
								<li>Website blogs</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						<p>By setting out very clear objectives, using strategic marketing and tracking analytics we can discover new ways to market ourselves in a world that is constantly changing.
